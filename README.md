# OCT-classification
OCT is a non-invasive technology used for the diagnosis of the eye, especially the retina. This project uses such OCT images to classify and aid in the diagnosis of age-related retinal problems.
This dataset consists of three retinal diseases.
CNV- Choroidal Neo Vascularisation
DME- Diabetic Macular edema
and DRUSEN.
There is a website that asks the user to upload the OCT image in specified formats and after uploading, the model will classify the image into one of the four output categories.
CNV, DME, DRUSEN or normal.
